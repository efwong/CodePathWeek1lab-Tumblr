Lab 1 Tumblr Demo app 
by Edwin Wong



## Completed Milestones:
* [+] Milestone 1: Setup
* [+] Milestone 2: Query tumblr api for posts
* [+] Milestone 3: Build Main photo view from queried photos
* [+] Milestone 4: Build Details Screen: PhotoDetailsView consists of a single UIImageView
* [+] Milestone 5: Add Pull to Refresh

## Completed Bonuses:
* [+] Bonus 1: Added Avatar header
* [+] Bonus 2: Infinite Scroll:
	implementation: I reused the posts pulled from the default tumblr query
			except, I added infinite scroll where it will only
			show 3 at a time. When a user reaches the end of the,
			current table, the app will check to see if there are
			more posts, if there are, it will increment the table
			row count, and reload the table to show more images.
				
* [+] Bonus 3: Added FullScreenPhotoViewController and zoom in feature


## Summary
* I was able to finish all milestones. I also finished the infinite scroll bonus, the avatar bonus, and the zoom in bonus.

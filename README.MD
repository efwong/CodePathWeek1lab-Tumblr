Week 1 Lab:
Tumblr Demo app 

Completed:
[+] Milestone 1: Setup
[+] Milestone 2: Query tumblr api for posts
[+] Milestone 3: Build Main photo view from queried photos
[+] Milestone 4: Build Details Screen: PhotoDetailsView consists of a single UIImageView
[+] Milestone 5: Add Pull to Refresh

[-] Bonus 1
[+] Bonus 2: Infinite Scroll:
	implementation: I reused the posts pulled from the default tumblr query
			except, I added infinite scroll where it will only
			show 3 at a time. When a user reaches the end of the,
			current table, the app will check to see if there are
			more posts, if there are, it will increment the table
			row count, and reload the table to show more images.
				
[-] Bonus 3


## Summary
I was able to finish all milestones. I also finished the infinite scroll bonus.
If I have more time, I will work on the other bonuses.
